# 🎯 Number Guessing Game – Java

A fun and interactive **console-based Number Guessing Game** written in **Java**, where the **computer randomly selects a number**, and **you try to guess it!**

---

## 🧠 Game Concept

The computer randomly generates a number within a specified range (e.g., 1 to 100), and you must guess what it is.  
After each guess, the program tells you if the correct number is **higher** or **lower** than your guess, until you get it right.

## 🔧 How It Works

- The computer selects a random number within a range (default is 1 to 100)
- You enter your guess in the console
- The program gives feedback:
  - `Too high!` → your guess is greater than the number
  - `Too low!` → your guess is less than the number
  - `Correct!` → you guessed the number
- Displays the total number of attempts taken

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Java (Core)
- `java.util.Scanner` for input
- `java.util.Random` for number generation
- Looping and conditional logic
